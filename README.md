# Final App

## Requirements

### App Type
Yes, it needs to be an Ionic app. Preferably, it will be tested on real mobile device (iOS or Android). If you can't get hold of a device, that's OK. 

### App Feature(s)
It should use at least one of the Cordova Native plugins found on https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/ 

### Database/Data Store
Preferably, the app also uses MongoDB. If it is not relevant to your app, that's OK.

### App Deployment
It's also preferable to utilize Heroku service. Again, if it is not an option, that's fine too.
If you cannot implement all the features that you envisioned for this app by end of the week 8, that is perfectly fine. But, please give some documentation of what you implemented and what you couldn't. And, share if you have some plans to implement in the future. 

Final course app should be submitted into GitHub repository using GitHub Classroom
